# Project Euler solutions in Python

The list of all the problems is available [here](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

A detailed explanation to the first 30 is available [here](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/project-euler-solutions/qqtpygtpmsrv#.VVXtIHW1FBd).

The code style in the first problems is questionable, I used Project Euler as a way to teach myself Python :)
