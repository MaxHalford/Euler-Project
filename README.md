# Project-Euler
This repository contains solutions to a famous list of problems available at projecteuler.net. The problems involve mathematical intuition and smart programming. I'm continuously writting a guide on how to solve each problem with Python. I believe is interesting for people who have never programmed in Python because it shows a lot of code optimization techniques..</p
